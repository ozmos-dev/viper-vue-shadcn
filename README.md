# Viper Vue Shadcn Starter Kit

This is a starter kit for Viper ([docs](https://viper.ozmos.dev) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ozmos-dev/viper)).

- [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/) for the components.
- Authentication ready to go
- Profile page to change password / update name and email
- Reusable password confirmation modal
- Status toats for easy messaging after performing actions
- Dark / light mode
- A few built in themes to choose from via [tweakcn](https://tweakcn.com/)

The package manager defaults to `bun` , if you'd like to use something else make sure to update the `dev` script in `composer.json`.

Run `bun i && composer dev` to get started building right away!
